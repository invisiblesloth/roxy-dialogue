````

Build with the additional path:

```

## Requirements

This plugin is designed to be used **with the [Roxy Engine](https://github.com/invisiblesloth/roxy-engine)**.  
It relies on Roxyâ€™s:

- Asset pool system (`roxy.Assets`)
- Sprite subclassing (`RoxySprite`)
- Input utilities and update loop
- Scene integration (`roxy.Scene`)

It will not work in non-Roxy game projects without modification.
